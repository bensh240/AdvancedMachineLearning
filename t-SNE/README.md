#  t-SNE for Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization

This notebook implements a detailed exercise on t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data. The goal is to implement and analyze t-SNE step-by-step, ensuring efficient and accurate computation.

---

## Overview

This assignment includes:

- Implementing the t-SNE algorithm from scratch
- Performing dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional datasets
- Visualizing the results using 2D projections
- Analyzing the behavior of the algorithm under different hyperparameter settings

You are expected to focus on efficiency and correctness, following best coding practices.

## Guidelines

- Efficient, **vectorized** code is required. Poor performance due to unnecessary loops will be penalized.
- Read and follow **all instructions** in the notebook carefully.
- You are responsible for ensuring your code runs end-to-end and produces correct results.
- You are allowed to use external libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.
- Add your own unit tests and validation logic as needed. While they are not graded, they help ensure correctness.

## Environment Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required packages:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
