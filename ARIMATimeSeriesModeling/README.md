# ARIMA Time Series Modeling

This notebook presents the design and implementation of an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. The assignment emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application of ARIMA modeling to real-world data.

## Overview

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

- **Theoretical Framework**: Introduction to ARIMA and its components (p, d, q)
- **Algorithm Design**: Steps for preparing data, estimating parameters, fitting the model, and generating forecasts
- **Implementation**: Application of the ARIMA process using Python
- **Residual Analysis**: Evaluation of model assumptions and performance based on residual diagnostics

This work highlights core concepts of statistical forecasting and model evaluation in time series analysis.
